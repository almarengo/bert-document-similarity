       "['\"I hear it all the time boo! Too bad I ain\\'t got the patience for anyone else\\'s problems!\"  That got me laughing even through all the pain. It really wasn\\'t that good. I hugged me best friend. I\\'m pretty sure I squeezed the life out of her.   I hung up hastily. Another day, another phone call he ignores.  \"Cleo go and answer the door!!\" I swear I feel like a bloody slave in this house!  I barely had enough time to go upstairs and change when a knock came at the door.  I got to work quickly cleaning the kitchen, bathroom and living room, which wasn\\'t easy since this woman was in the way! When I finished I had sweat pouring all down my face. I was shattered!  Her face immediately darkened and I knew this wasn\\'t good. \"Ehhhh! If you\\'re not a baby anymore then you can go and find a job and start paying rent! Now hurry up and tidy! Uncle Tony will be here in 30 minutes!!!\" She turned her attention back to the tv, where she was watching some poorly edited  film on Nollywood  \"Mum!! I\\'m 17 not 2! Please stop treating me like a baby!\"  Her expression softened and her face lit up with glee, catching me off guard. \"Ohhhhh studying hard for school! Mi bah! (My baby)  Come, let me give you nufwo (breast milk)\" she tried to pull my face to her breasts but I was having none of that.  \"Mum! I was up all night studying for my psychology exam. I fell asleep.\" I replied carefully trying to hide my impatience at her lack of understanding. This woman is like a time bomb, never know when she\\'s going to explode.  \"HMM!!\" She kissed her teeth giving me death glares. Boy if looks could kill!!! \"What have I told you about leaving the house untidy before you go to bed??!\" She questioned, her voice revealing a slight African accent.  I quickly ran down the stairs knowing that if I were to make her wait any longer, my curvaceous black ass would be on the receiving end of a firm beating. Now I may be 17 and taller than this woman, but she will not hesitate to remove that slipper and beat me till the cows come home.  \"AH! CLEO!! Brah ha! (Twi for Come here!)  Hurry up! My mum screamed clearly getting impatient.  \"Cleo Ansah! Come on, tidy up the house before uncle Tony gets here!\" My mum bellowed from the living room. I sighed, mentally pushing all feelings to one side. I can\\'t dwell on it too much. If he can treat me like this then clearly I meant nothing to him! And also-  It\\'s not even the fact that he took my virginity, although I must admit it wasn\\'t exactly how I imagined it would be, far from it actually. It\\'s the fact that he just stopped talking to me. We would speak everyday, 27/7. Even when I had college, we would talk all day between classes and stay up all night. I trusted him with everything, I told him everything. He was my best friend for 3 whole years and he just left me after taking a thing most precious to me.  Unable to contain my anger, I threw my phone watching as it smashed into the wall breaking into pieces. I hate how he\\'s making me feel like this. I feel used, disgusted, hurts but most the most overwhelming of all the emotions, betrayal. I never knew it could hurt this bad. It\\'s been 2 fucking months! 2 months and I haven\\'t heard from him. 2 months since he started ignoring me. 2 months since he took my virginity and dumped my ass like I was worthless.  *Your call has been forwarded to the T-Mobile voicemail service 077-*  My hand started twitching. I knew it was a bad idea but I just couldn\\'t help myself. I grabbed my phone, furiously typing his number.  I should have waited. I shouldn\\'t have given in so easily. It\\'s times like this that I wish there was some way to travel back in time or even listened when my mum said \"don\\'t trust guys!!\"  I stared at my phone as if it were the root of all my problems. Perhaps I had been too eager? They say guys don\\'t like a girl who gives in easily, but since when was I classed as that kind of girl? It\\'s been around 2 months already. I thought about texting him but that hasn\\'t got me anywhere so far. He just ignores those too.  Maybe it\\'s time I just gave up, it\\'s not likely that he\\'s going to call me back, not after what I gave him. I sighed running my hands through my hair frustrated at my situation. How hard is it to pick up a damn phone!?? I felt that pang deep down in my stomach, you know? The one that you feel when you\\'re too hurt beyond words to describe how you feel.  My story isn\\'t exactly your typical one although it does start out with a guy. And I fell for him. Fast.  *Your call has been forwarded to the T-Mobile voicemail service 077-* \"Thank you Nicky. You always know just what to say. Has anyone ever told you that you should become a life coach!\"   \"I know you miss him babe but think of it this way. If he can claim leave you taking your virtue after claiming that he cared about you, then he\\'s really not worth the pain and hassle. Some guys are dogs. You just happened to fall for a bad one but that doesn\\'t mean that there isn\\'t someone out there who can make you just as, if not, happier than he ever could. Don\\'t dwell on the past hunny, move past that wasteman prick. As you said, the sex weren\\'t even that good!\"  Nicole wrapped her arms around me burying me in her warm embrace. I shook my head in response. \"Nothing Nicky, not even a text. It\\'s like he\\'s disappeared off the face of the Earth which I know isn\\'t true because Kenneth said he\\'s heard from him recently and he has the same number, which means that he IS specifically just avoiding me, which makes me sad and hurt that he would do this to me. I don\\'t know what to do Nicky. I miss the friendship that we had.\"  Warm tears started trickling down my face.  \"You\\'re thinking about him again,\" She said pulling me out of my thoughts. She could always tell when I was thinking about him. \"Has he still not called you back?\"  Nicole always knows how to make me smile. She\\'s been my bestest friend for as long as I can remember. We\\'re practically sisters since we grew up together. She\\'s the only person who knows all the explicit details about what happened with HIM.  \"GOOD MORNING BOLTIMORE!!\" We both sang, well screamed, at the top of our voices while trying to munch through bags of Doritos, Oreos and Ribena. This pretty much continued throughout the film. Heck we even sang the songs playing on the credits. \"Girl what you waiting for?? You best put that film on!\" I nestled into Nicky\\'s bed getting comfortable while she put our favourite film on, Hairspray. That\\'s my film right there! No one can even talk about that film!  We giggled at our silliness before raiding the kitchen of all junk food carrying it all up the stairs to her room.  I laughed loudly wrapping my arm around her waist, leading her into the house. \"You know how it is baby. Mans feeling kinda fresh innit! Mans always gotta be lookin fresh!\" I replied poppin my collar.  \"Oooh girl! You looking fine today! I see you going all out to try and impress me! No need baby girl, you had me at hello! She said after finally pulling away.  Oof! I barely had time to blink before she opened the door, running into me with a thud engulfing me in what can only be described as a monster bear hug.  The sun was shining and the air was warm as I made my way to Nicole\\'s house. It was a nice summers day which is always surprising in London and I could hear the kids playing outside In the streets. It didn\\'t take me long to get to Nicole\\'s house considering that she only lives a few roads away from me. I knocked on her door waiting patiently for her to answer!  I put on my electric blue skinny jeans with a white vest top and my black leather jacket. I finished my outfit with my blue and white Jordan\\'s adding some cute silver studs and some accessories. I shoved my long, frizzy black hair into a low bun before grabbing the necessities and leaving the house shouting a quick goodbye to my mum and Uncle Tony.  \"Love you boo!\" We hung up and I immediately started getting dressed.  \"You know I\\'ll be over in 10. See ya sweet cheeks!\"  \"Girl! You need to come down to my house ASAP! Don\\'t want you emotionally scarred after hearing that nastiness!\" Yes people, my mum and uncle Tony are hooking up. Eugh! The thought makes me sick!  \"Nothin much, old man Tony is downstairs. I really don\\'t wanna be here when shit goes down. Eugh!\" I fake shuddered knowing she wouldn\\'t be able to see me but still adding dramatic effect to our conversation.  \"It\\'s all good boo boo! I\\'m at home! What you doing?\" \"Nicole!!! My girrrllllll!! How you do baby boo?!\" I replied, a smile breaking onto my face.  \"CLEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!\" She screamed into my ear. I love this girl she always knows how to cheer me up.  I quickly let him in, running away from his intense pervy stare. I flopped onto my bed, no longer feeling the need to call him, but angry at what he did to me. Grabbing the house phone , i felt the need to vent, so I called the one girl that always had my back.  Uncle Tony stood their grinning in all his pervy goodness, his eyes raking over my legs which were  left uncovered by the shorts I was wearing. Ugh he makes me feel sick! I know what you\\'re thinking, pervy uncle checking out his niece, nasty! Don\\'t get it twisted, we\\'re not actually related. We Ghanians call our parent\\'s friend auntie/uncle out of respect, no relation required.  We stayed up the rest of the night talking, eating and prank calling before finally falling asleep. For the first time in 2 months, I was happy.\\n']"

       "'I was cut off by a tap on my shoulder. I bent my head backwards to see Aimee. I grinned. No feelings! I stopped mid grin and got up.   Crap. What if she got realesed? What if she escaped? There goes my ticket to life out of this hell hole. I knew she\\'d leave. She probably left cause of me. Cra-   I sat down in the familiar chairs waiting for Aimme. I glanced at the wall clock that hung above the small table. She\\'s 10 minutes late.  I sat up ready to see Aimee. I grinned thinking of her face when i kissed her. She\\'ll fall for me in no time. Might as well have fun before I crush her wittle heart.   Jason\\'s POV    I offered her my chair. So much for no feelings and rudeness. I quickly sat on the chair and pulled her on my lap. Back to the plan. I groaned. Just when I thought Allie was gonna do something right, she pulls one on me. And ruins my day. I sighed and walked over to my lump, falling asleep.   \"Hell no! Your lonely! Embrace any company you get!\" she said with a wink.   \"Are you gonna beat the shit outta him?\" I asked, excited. The perv had it coming!   \"That douche bag!\" she yelled, loud enough to gain strange looks by passing guards.   I was hesitant if to tell her what happened or not. She could either freak out and tell me how lucky I am or freak out and beat the shit outta Jason. Probably the second one. I grinned, I should tell her.   \"Same thing as that Jason guy. Anyway, how was your day with that cutie? I saw him by the door earlier.\" she said teasingly.     \"Ohh ok. What\\'s he in for?\" I asked pulling away some of the food from the package. \"Ok. She was realesed early. I\\'m stuck with some old guy named Timothy Johnson now.\" she said, shrugging. I couldn\\'t help myself. She was just like me, she hated police and she had an attitude. I think I really like her.  No Jason! Your just going to get what you want and dump her, remember what happened last time when you \"liked\" a girl? She died. She went out and DIED! No love! I yelled at myself.  Ughh. Fuck it. I pushed her on the table and kissed her harshly. She was ok with it until she wanted to be a bitch and pull away. Then slap me. She fuc- Stop Jason, I cut myself off.  \"How was your day with Cindi?\" I asked.  I was dragged back down the corridor back to my cell. Allie was already sitting there eating what i guessed to be a present from Marci.   Aimee\\'s POV \\'\\'Don\\'t. Touch. Me\" She growled.  I shot her a grin and did the unexpected. I apologized.  She looked surprised and was about to speak when the guard walked in.  Yanking me back to my cell, annoying guard guy gave me a nod in the direction of Aimee entering her cell. I felt my cheeks warm up. Did he know about that? Ooops.  I didn\\'t matter anyway. To me , she\\'s only a piece to the puzzle, my ticket to a house and food when I leave this hell hole.  She tried pulling away, lifting her hand, threatening another smack to my face. I ignored her and kissed her neck. She shivered.    She turned on my lap so she was facing me, pressing her lips to mine.   This is to easy. Laying on the crappy lump or as they like to call it, \"bed\", I thought about how I could get Aimee to fall for me. Caught up in my plans, I fell asleep thinking about what will happen tomorrow.   \"Hey baby.\" I breathed. Jason\\'s POV   \"Don\\'t stare at what you can\\'t have\" she repeated me with a smirk.\\n'"

       "'Shit. \"Erm, sure. Okay.\" I answered nervously after a couple of seconds contemplation. We are turned to each other, and got ready. Dan placed his hands on my waist, and mine around his neck. Why? No. No, this can\\'t be happening. I\\'d fetched Dan\\'s coffee and my juice and was going back to the table. Just before I turned the corner I peered round, hoping Dan had his back to me so I could make him jump. (Brooke\\'s POV) ******************* \"Shhh, don\\'t worry Dan, she\\'ll understand if you explain everything to her. She\\'ll understand don\\'t worry.\" She hugged me close and rubbed circles into my back. \"What am I going to tell Brooke?\" I said as tears began to fall down my face. \"Jesus fucking Christ! What the fuck was that?!\" I screamed, as the security guards carried her away. Leasha stared open mouthed at the scene. I sat down on a stool and Leasha ran over and hugged me. \"I know you like her. A lot. But she can\\'t kiss for shit. Here, let me show you how it\\'s done.\" I had to process what the fuck she just said. No time for that shit. Before I knew it,she\\'d grabbed my face and crashed her lips down on mine. What the fuck is happening? It took me a couple of seconds to get her off me with the help of Phil. \"Hey, I\\'m Naomi.\" She stated confidently. She did the usual, \\'can you sign my book in a funny way and sign my shirt, etc, etc\\' then something. weird happened. Really weird. Scary weird. Brooke had just gone to get drinks for us and Phil had waved up another fan. This year was certainly more popular than last year. The girl seemed unusually confident compared to some of the other people we\\'d had today, it was weird. (Dan\\'s POV) ***************** \"Okay, no problem, back in a bit.\" I sang, kissing him on the cheek and skipping off to the coffee machine. \"I wouldn\\'t mind a coffee?\" Dan asked in reply. \"No, We\\'re good.\" Phil and Leasha said in unison, raising their bottles of water. Creepy pair. \"Hey, guys. I\\'m just going to get a drink, do you want anything?\" I asked, turning to them all, just before anyone came up to the table. They all thanked us and wandered off to meet other YouTuber\\'s. \"Awww, that\\'s so going on Tumblr! Check the \\'Bran\\' tag and the \\'danisnotonfire\\' tag when you get the chance! It\\'s so cute!\" She then sang, uploading it from her camera to Tumblr, using the hotel WiFi. \"Oh, my, God! That came out great, look!\" She said showing us all the camera screen. I had to admit, it did look cute. \"3, 2, 1, GO!\" The girl called. Our lips collided, and despite being together for so long, there were still butterflies every time. We heard cheering and \\'aww\\'-ing as we pulled apart. We both turned back to the crowd of people all stood there with cameras and then back to the three fans who came up with the idea. \"Yeah, it is. I can\\'t believe I never noticed it before!\" He whispered, before untangling our fingers and wrapping his arm round my waist as we walked. One beautiful willow tree stood tall and proud at the far side of the park. Not many people were over there so I gently nudged Dan over towards the tree and sat down. I say gently, but it was more like I yanked his arm out if it\\'s socket and threw him on the floor before jumping on the ground next to him and sitting cross-legged before realising I possibly might have hurt him. \"Shit, Dan are you okay?\" I questioned, leaning forward and shaking his shoulder a bit. I received a groan as a reply and it worried me. \"Dan, answer me are you okay?\". Nothing. He was lead face down on the ground, clutching his other arm. \"Dan? I\\'m so sorry, I didn\\'t mean to hurt you. It was an accident, I got carried away, I wasn\\'t-\" I was cut off by Dan rising from the ground, grabbing my waist, pulling me underneath him and being tickled to death. \"Apologise! That hurt you know!\" Dan cackled, digging his fingers into my sides making me squirm uncontrollably. I couldn\\'t speak for all the laughter, so he kept tickling, and tickling and tickling.\"You do realise I\\'m not going to stop until you apologise.\" He smirked. I took hold of his wrists, momentarily causing him to stop. I took a deep breath and said, \" I\\'m sorry, Dan. I didn\\'t mean to hurt you.\" I stared into his sparkling eyes with the straightest face I could manage. \"Thank you.\" He whispered before leaning down and pecking me lightly on the lips. He rolled off me and grabbed my hands, pulling me up. \"I think we should be childish and carve our names into this tree.\" Dan sassed. After we\\'d all finished our lunch, I dragged Dan across the mall and out the entrance to a park I\\'d spotted on the way in. \"I hate shopping centres and malls, there are too many people about, shoving and shouting a losing their kids all the time. I feel like I\\'m in a whirlwind of noise and I\\'m stuck there for hours. \"I\\'m pretty much the same,\" Dan replied, tangling our fingers together and rubbing my knuckles with his thumb, \"I\\'m forever losing Phil in shopping centres if it\\'s busy. Plus I hate people shouting whilst someones telling me something,so if Phil\\'s telling me when and where to meet and someone else is shouting I\\'m like \\'eurgh asdfghjkl, yeah sure\\' but in reality I heard none of it and get an angry phone call off Phil an hour later asking where I am.\" Dan moaned, waving his hand about in frustration. \"Jesus...I just dont like them. You, on the other hand, have serious unresolved issues with them!\" I laughed, resting my head on his shoulder as we walked. The smell of the greenery became stronger as we strolled through the big black gates with the stone posts and into the park. All the trees were beginning to blossom and the daffodils were dancing in the gentle breeze. \"This place is nicer than I thought.\" I muttered, in awe at the beautiful scenery around me. \"You have anything to do it with?\" I asked, searching around for something relatively sharp. \"Yup.\" He shouted, before pulling a penknife out of his jeans pocket and brandishing it proudly. \"Dan, why the fuck have you got a freaking penknife in your pocket?\" I questioned. \"To become the Manliest Of Men!\" He stated before raising it like Excalibur. I couldn\\'t control my laughter anymore. \"It\\'s not that funny, Brooke. Come on, let\\'s do this!\" He shouted leaning on the tree trunk and engraving his name before passing me the knife, and I too engraved my name into the wood. \"Now we will be here forever, even if we never come back. Let\\'s take a photo to remember this.\" He said before reaching into his other pocket and pulling out his phone. He put his arm around my waist and left just a big enough gap for the markings to be seen between our heads and snapped the picture. *********************** An hour and a half later, Phil, Leasha, Dan and I had all gone back to the hotel and headed straight to bed as we were all shattered and Dan and Phil had their big meet up thing tomorrow. (Dan\\'s POV) \"Brooke? I just need to talk to Phil for a minute I\\'ll be right back.\" I whispered. \"You do realise I don\\'t own you, you can go places and not tell me, you know?\" She murmured groggily. \"Someone\\'s tired!\" I sang, getting up off the bed. \"Yes, now piss off so I can sleep!\" She grinned, throwing a pillow at my head. I closed the wooden door to our room and padded through the short corridor to the kitchen to find Phil in the kitchen with a glass of water in one hand and a cup of tea in the other. \"Hey Phil, can I talk to you for a sec?\" I asked, in a whisper so Leasha and Brooke wouldn\\'t hear. \"Sure, what\\'s up?\" He replied, sipping his water and putting the cup of tea back down on the side. \"Nothing\\'s up per say, but I\\'m just a little apprehensive about tomorrow, I mean what if something goes wrong? I\\'m still excited, don\\'t get me wrong! I\\'m just a little more nervous than usual.\" \"Don\\'t worry about it, Dan. If anyone needs to be nervous it\\'s me! I\\'m planning on telling everyone about me and Leasha tomorrow. You have nothing to worry about, me, Leasha and Brooke are all going to be there too. Come on, we need some sleep.\" He said before patting my shoulder and retrieving the cup and heading back to his room and Leasha\\'s company. I quickly ran my hands through my hair before returning to my own bed and Brooke. I suppose I was still looking forward to tomorrow, but some part of me was still nervous. *************************** (The Next Day, Brooke\\'s POV) I noticed, when I woke up, that Dan wasn\\'t in bed. \"Dan?\" I called, waiting a few seconds for a response. \"Yes, love?\" He replied, with a muffled voice. \"Where are you?\" I asked, clambering out of bed and towards his voice. \"Here!\" Dan yelled right in my face as I turned towards the bathroom. I nearly dies, I swear to God. \"Dan! Why would you do that! That\\'s not even funny any more!\" I laughed, collapsing into his chest, thumping him gently. \"Sorry. Hey, you nearly ready?\" He replied, giving me a gentle hug, calming my now sky-high heart rate. \"Why, what time is it?\" \"It\\'s almost time to g-\" I cut him off by yelling. \"Why the fuck didn\\'t you wake me up you shit! Do you realise I\\'m going to look like a complete arse because you didn\\'t wake me up in time! I know I\\'m a bitch when you wake me up, but jeez, this is ridiculous. Ahhhh!\"I yelled, running around finding clothes, and applying minimal make-up to save time, then grabbing Dan by the hand and running to Phil and Leasha\\'s room. They were both sat on the bed with a cup of tea, having a chat about old times or some shit. \"Guys, guys, guys, guys. You ready to go?! Dan, the prick, forgot to wake me up and now we have to go and I look like shit! Come on!\" Not waiting for their reply, I let go of Dan\\'s hand and grabbed the cups from their hands. Placing them on the sides, I then took both of their hands and dragged them from the edge of the bed and through the door to the elevator. I checked my phone and we were now running on time so I chilled out for a bit. Once we got down to the lobby, I\\'d completely chilled out and was sat down at Dan and Phil\\'s table with Leasha, with a fruity drink thing. We were just chatting, and observing as the queue got longer and longer with more girls and a couple of lads. I was surprised at how many people were here to meet them! I mean, I knew they were popular, but I didn\\'t think they were this popular. The pair of them stood up as the first pair of girls came up to them, surprisingly calm in comparison to the others in the queue. \"Hey, what\\'re your names?\" Phil asked, calmly, taking the notepad that they were holding out to him and scribbling their names and a sweet little message for them. Dan took the notepad and drew some retarded fiery unicorn or some shit like that. With Dan, you can never tell. An hour or so went past and I got extremely bored. Until Dan called me and snapped me out of it. \"Huh, what?\" I shouted in response. \"Come take a picture with us!\" Leasha called. I had really been out of it, I hadn\\'t realised that Leasha had gone up. Two girls and a lad were stood clutching cameras, practically bouncing through the roof with excitement. \"Oh, sorry, I\\'m coming!\" I fixed my hair as I walked over to them all. I squeezed in between Dan and the lad, whose name was Alex, and smiled a cheesy grin for one of the girls, pulling a stupid face for Alex, and then my worst fear. Most people think it\\'s cute, but it terrified me, and I knew it would happen sooner or later. The second girl said, \"Could you and Dan kiss,and Phil and Leasha kiss then Alex and Charlotte kiss? That\\'s be so cute and adorable and give everyone feels on Tumblr!\" Phil and Leasha thought it\\'s be really cute and a good idea, Charlotte and Alex were up for it, and Dan wasn\\'t objecting either.\\n'"
